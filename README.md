# Raspberry Pi Python Robotics Platform

This project is an attempt to simplify the setup and development of a simple python based robotics platform that leverages a Raspberry Pi or other SBC with GPiO pins

## Setup

The code here leverages existing libraries as dependancies, the needed dependancies can be seen and installed using [pipreqs](https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs)

At repository root run:

- `pip install pipreqs`
- `pipreqs`

This will install pipreqs and create a file, `requirements.txt` listing dependancies

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

And this will install them all in one go
